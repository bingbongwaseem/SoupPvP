# SoupPvP

## Wiki
Before you read any of this, most/all of this information and even more can be found on the ``wiki``. The wiki states all information that you need regarding the plugin and all information that you'd like. I am suggesting to go to the ``wiki``, and not reading this. You can click on the ``wiki`` button above, or you can go to it by clicking [here](https://github.com/bingbongwaseem/SoupPvP/wiki)

### SoupPvP Core
Hello there everyone, my name is waseem and this core has been created just to add something spicy to my portfolio. All concepts and all code that is stated should work right now. 
However, know that the code is still **not** tested!

### Developer API
You can check information on the API via the ``wiki``, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/bingbongwaseem/SoupPvP/wiki/API)! The API has everything any developer would need to complete his plugin or to customize the SoupPvP plugin to the max!

### Optimization
I've tried to optimize the plugin to my hardest, saving happens per 5 minutes to help the server not lag. Everything saves onto the mongo and nothing really to the config.yml.

### Configuration
You can check out information on the configuration via the ``wiki``, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/bingbongwaseem/SoupPvP/wiki/Configuration)! The wiki shows the configuration of which can and may be located via ``src/main/recources/config.yml``

### Data Storage
You can choose between 2 of the following data storages:
* YML Storage
* Mongo Storage

### Permissions
You can check out information on the permissions via the ``wiki``, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/bingbongwaseem/SoupPvP/wiki/Permissions)! However, a small sum up is that this plugin will have many ``permissions``. However, for now only future permissions are stored. This may be changed very frequently.

### PlaceHolderAPI
You can check out information on the PlaceHolder(s) available via the ``wiki``, or by click [here](https://github.com/bingbongwaseem/SoupPvP/wiki/PlaceHolder(s))! However, a small sum up is that this plugin does support PlaceHolderAPI and it has multiple PlaceHolders that you can use within your server. You can ``toggle`` PlaceHolderAPI inside of the ``config.yml``
